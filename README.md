# CUNY-Verse
# Event organizer? 

# CUNY events entered into one website, workshops, and like events in general where you could bookmark them & RSVP.

# maybe have a limit to how many people can RSVP (would prob need a API)

# Search up different colleges and it should display the events that theyâ€™re hosting.

# If there are any requirements, if its open or closed to a specific college.

# Allow for ~1000 users
